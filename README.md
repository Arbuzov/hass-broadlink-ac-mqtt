# Home Assistant broadlink MQTT addon repository

This addon embedds [liaan/broadlink_ac_mqtt](https://github.com/liaan/broadlink_ac_mqtt) project into Home assistant addons. I do not plan to add any new features into the parent application, but I am open if someone propose another project as parent.

To make your devices working you must:

* Install this addon
* Install [Mosquitto broker](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto) or something like this to manage MQTT
* Get IP and MAC addresses of your devices
* Connect this addon to the Mosquitto
* Setup your [device topics](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/broadlink-ac-integration-ac-freedom-aux-dunham-rcool-akai-rinnai-kenwood-tornado-ballu/342789)
